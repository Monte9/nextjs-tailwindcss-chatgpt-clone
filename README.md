## TODO

1. When clicking the "New Chat" button, a new "New Conversation" tab should appear in the sidebar, and the message scope should switch to this new conversation. Clicking again on a conversation that already has a history should display the previous messages once again.
2. Add an option to close the sidebar on desktop displays.
3. Add translation support for other languages.
